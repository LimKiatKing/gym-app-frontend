# gym-app-backend
This is a software development project to reinforce my coding
fundamentals. The key goal is to be able to build a full stack 
project.

This project consist of 2 repo, gym-app-backend and gym-app-frontend.

# Background
The inspiration for this app stems from a rock climber's frustration
with the existing, in some cases non-existent, climbing gym 
management app.

# Scope
The main function of this app is to be able to manage gym booking 
and share multi-pass (gym credits) with friends. 

Users will be able to:
- View gym schedule
- Book a gym slot
- Add/remove other users
- Utilize friend's multi-pass for gym booking

The following features is out of scope and will not be covered 
in this project: login authentication & payment system.

# Getting Started
The frontend is run by React

In the terminal, you can run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The React app will be connected to localhost:8080.

User login will be done by user ID (e.g. '1001') at the top right. 
Once logged in, the user will be able to navigate the site.
